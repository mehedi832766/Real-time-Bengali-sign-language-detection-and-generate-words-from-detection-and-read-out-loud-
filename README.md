# Real-time-Bengali-sign-language-detection-and-generate-words-from-detection-and-read-out-loud-
This project will be detecting sign language in real-time using YOLOv7 on Colab and generate words from those detection and also read those words out loud.

yolov7 file is the main code with all the steps from training data to detecting in real time.

on the otherhand , the plug_and_play notebook is just "plug and play". Copy this to your colab and copy the "plug and play" folder to your drive's main directory, then just run the notebook and see the magic. white background will give more better results.
